So many time it fail because I don't do it every day, so this is MY procedure and hint about AWS complexity.

Start a new AWS EC2 instance (better to start with a pre-made image):
- NOTE You must have the Key on the Computer somewhere. If you download a NEW key do a "chmod 400 keyname.pem" to make it readonly.
If "ssh -i aws-key.pem ubuntu@12.345.67.89" dosen't work try: "ssh -i aws-key.pem ec2-user@12.345.67.89"

Security groups: Make sure sure Security group you want to use have TCP Port Open on the Port# you have:
Custom TCP Rule  / TCP / 8888 / "0.0.0.0/0"

If (success) and brand new server then

If a Pre-made Bitnami server:
Some Info: https://docs.bitnami.com/virtual-machine/infrastructure/nodejs/
Stopping the Birnami server: $sudo /opt/bitnami/ctlscript.sh stop

Setup the Env variable for the server:
export PORTSERVER=1701

Express:
export PORT=8888
export LOCALADD=http://54.161.166.149

$ npm install forever -g
Go in the spaceServer and run: npm install; forever ./bin/www
Go in the spaceReactRender and run: npm install; npm build; npm server  (OR: $ static -a 0.0.0.0 & )
The server address "env.LOCALADD" might not work so check that.
