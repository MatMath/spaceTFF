# spaceTFF
I always been fascinated about Space exploration and everything around it. Often I just run the calculation on my side and it end there. But Instead I wanted to improve my Node, React, svg skills so I decided to do everything from scratch.

## How to run?
Locally: Go in the 2 folder and run the server and then the front end.
In each folder run: npm install; npm start
On the server you need to build it so look at AWS_setup.txt
